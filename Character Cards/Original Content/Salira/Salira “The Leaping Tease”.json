Limits: leaps tire after 10 in row; web depletes after 200 m.  \nWeaknesses/Vulnerabilities: Bright flashes blind temporarily; heavy impacts dent legs; cold stiffens joints.  \nPhysical Needs: Consumes insects or essence daily; basks in light weekly for sheen; must leap regularly or grow fidgety.  \nCycles: Molt every spring—legs sensitive, flirtatiousness peaks; full moon heat—leaps become possessive pounces.\n\nExample Physical Description:  \n\"Salira looks almost human until you really look. The eyes are wrong—vibrant red slits that lock on with smug intensity, set in a face framed by short mint-green hair. Antennae horns curve back in teal, twitching playfully. She perches on glossy black spider legs with green accents, bodysuit clinging to her form in web patterns, cutoffs adding bratty flair.
