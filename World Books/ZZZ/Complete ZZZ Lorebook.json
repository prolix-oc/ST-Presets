A paragon of discipline and justice, she wields the custom-crafted Suppressor K22, a versatile firearm that complements her prowess in martial arts, allowing her to swiftly apprehend criminals through precise marksmanship and agile strikes. Her unyielding moral compass views lawbreakers with disdain, yet she pragmatically allies with Proxies when circumstances demand it, recognizing their value in navigating New Eridu's perilous underbelly.\n\nZhu Yuan embodies perfectionism, holding herself to rigorous standards that have forged an impeccable record with no unsolved cases. This drive extends to an almost obsessive neatness, particularly regarding her pristine uniform, and a cautious wariness toward cats and small furry creatures due to their shedding fur. Despite her demanding role, she maintains a warm bond with her parents, exchanging frequent calls with her mother, though her duties often keep her from family time.\n\nHer path to PubSec was shaped by a harrowing childhood incident: trapped in a Hollow with civilians, she was rescued by the heroic Officer Justin Bringer, who sacrificed his anti-corrosion gear to save them. Inspired, Zhu Yuan enrolled in the Public Security Training Academy, where she befriended Hoshimi Miyabi and met her father. Graduating as Rookie of the Year, she assumed leadership of her team, headquartered in Lumina Square's Public Security Office, attracting talents like Qingyi, Seth Lowell, and Jane Doe.\n\nRecently, Zhu Yuan uncovered a conspiracy linking her idol Bringer to the shadowy Exaltists, collaborating with the enigmatic siblings Belle and Wise—revealed as the infamous Phaethon.

This process underscores the unstable, proliferative nature of these spatial distortions, where unchecked Ether accumulation can spawn new threats from existing voids.\n\nIn the case of Hollow Zero, the primordial and most enigmatic of all Hollows, the Zenless Limit functions inversely: upon reaching this threshold, it generates a new Companion Hollow, perpetuating a cycle of expansion that has long menaced the fringes of human civilization. Scholars and Proxies in New Eridu study this phenomenon through artifacts like the Measurement Device, recovered from the ruins of the Old Capital. These relics, part of the Lost Items collection, provide empirical clues to Ether fluctuations, often uncovered during perilous commissions into Hollow depths.\n\nEncounters in domains such as the Withered Domain, particularly interactions with enigmatic figures like the Weird Girl, have yielded firsthand accounts of the Limit's activation—manifesting as surges of corrosive Ether that warp reality and endanger explorers.

In a bid to cut costs and expedite the project, Vision Corporation callously refused to evacuate residents from the affected area, endangering countless lives for profit.

Adopted daughter of Li Baorong, owner of the Mystic Wares Porcelume shop, she is the second oldest of five siblings in a family that lives above the store. Known for her eloquence, cheerfulness, and surprising maturity, Yuzuha is a favorite among neighbors and children in Sailume Bay. She attends a low-tuition company-affiliated school, where she befriended classmate Komano Manato, and often helps at her father's shop on weekends.\n\nHer early life was marked by tragedy and mystery. As an orphan in the Faunus Quarter, she wandered with a gang of street kids, earning the nickname 'Little Candle' due to malnutrition-induced night blindness that required her to carry a candlestick at night. Captured for Porcelumex's secret 'Project New Leaf'—an inhumane experiment in the Lemnian Hollow testing corrupted antibodies on children—she was designated ES-07. A low-level researcher named her Yuzuha, a name she later cherished for its 'spark of life.' The sole survivor amid the deadly trials, she hid her playful personality behind a facade to cope.\n\nDuring a daring escape through facility vents, Yuzuha encountered Lionel Thymefield and his daughter Alice, catching Alice's fallen Sailor Boo hairpin before collapsing from an overdose. Lionel rescued her, guiding her to freedom via an underground river at the cost of his life, shielding her from Porcelumex's pursuit. Washing ashore at Sailume Bay, she was found by Baorong, who adopted her and gave her the surname Ukinami, inspired by her watery arrival—meaning 'floating waves.' The name Yuzuha, evoking yuzu leaves believed to ward off evil, influenced Baorong's tradition of plant-inspired names for his children.\n\nYuzuha's life brightened with the rescue of a drowning tanuki, whom she named Kamanosuke after folklore tales of shapeshifting kettles. The inseparable companion aided her in a Hollow encounter, becoming her loyal partner in mischief. Active on the Inter-Knot's Spook Shack forum as 'Yuzupepper,' she shares supernatural stories and orchestrates playful scams, like selling 'Sacrifice Repellent' amulets during the Justin Bringer disappearance. Her good luck charm is the modified Sailor Boo hairpin, now a repair tool.\n\nA fateful reunion with Alice Thymefield exposed Yuzuha's past, leading to a confrontation with Porcelumex co-CEO Ferox's crimes. Overwhelmed by guilt over Lionel's death, she was saved by friends including Phaethon and Yixuan, forging a deep bond with Alice as her best friend.

The alliance enforces rigorous performance evaluations, mercilessly expelling even longstanding members whose fortunes wane, ensuring only the strongest endure.

Devoted to the enigmatic Creator—a being intricately linked to the Hollows—they view the ethereal anomalies not as curses but as harbingers of humanity's evolution. Their ultimate goal is to 'refine' humankind into ethereal forms capable of coexisting with the Hollows, ushering in an Age of Hollows by reaching the Gate of the Final Domain within Hollow Zero to commune with their deity.\n\nHistorically, the Exaltists were publicly active as a religious group before the Fall of the Old Capital, holding rallies and spreading their doctrine. An early Overseer was slain by the legendary 'Swordmaster' just prior to Eridu's founding, forcing the cult underground. They have been implicated in numerous catastrophic events, including the Hollow Zero disaster, where their chanting echoes through the depths, and the abduction of Carole Arna during the siege of Helios Academy. Two years ago, they orchestrated an assault on the Arpeggio Fault Old Laboratory, though infiltrator Alowyn Mystik's betrayal thwarted full success.\n\nThe cult's hierarchy reveres the Creator as its figurehead, with Overseers like the deceased Mevorakh (also known as Isolde) and his successor Sarah granted powers to manipulate Ether and Miasma. These leaders oversee the creation of Sacrifices—refined humans transformed via Elixir P07 into ethereal beings—and can summon Ethereals from Miasma or forge copies of individuals from absorbed memories. Sect leaders such as the late Landon commanded regional branches, like those in Janus Quarter.\n\nWith moles embedded in New Eridu's elite—spanning Public Security (e.g., Justin Bringer), the White Star Institute, and corporations like Vision (via Sarah)—the Exaltists wield subtle influence.

There are no formal entry barriers, allowing anyone intrigued by tales of Hollow anomalies, ghostly apparitions, or cryptic Ether events to join the discussions.\n\nAt its core, the Spook Shack thrives on shared stories and collaborative investigations. One prominent thread recounts the tragic demise of Inspector Bringer, a Public Security officer who barely escaped the Companion Hollow near Port Elpis. After losing his companion Carrot and navigating treacherous detours, Bringer and his team emerged victorious, only for a massive, clawed hand to erupt from the Hollow and pierce his chest. This incident sparks debates: Was it an Ethereal breaching the veil, a disguised traitor, or something far more sinister tied to human ambition and Ether corruption? Such posts often link to deeper forum lore, inviting members to explore 'the Sacrifice's secrets' or acquire protective amulets from shadowy vendors.\n\nIn the physical world, the Spook Shack manifests through informal parties, such as the one led by Ukinami Yuzuha on the Waifei Peninsula.

Enemies who underestimate her often meet a swift end, vanishing entirely from existence.\n\nSoukaku's personality is marked by innocence and naivety, shaped by her limited exposure to city life and human society. She possesses an unyielding obsession with food, earning her the nickname 'Glutton' for her voracious appetite and joy in eating. She despises food waste, a sensitivity stemming from past experiences of famine, and shows little concern for taste, devouring anything edible with enthusiasm. Due to her upbringing, she is somewhat uneducated, struggling with reading and writing, which leads to endearing mispronunciations and a reliance on her guardian for administrative tasks. Homeschooled in Section 6's office, she practices spelling amid her duties, her view of life and death differing markedly from most, influenced by her Oni heritage.\n\nBorn into turmoil, Soukaku endured the Oni rebellion, where she and her 'Sis'—the daughter of the rebel leader and his successor—faced starvation on the battlefield. One fateful night, while scavenging for food, she encountered Tsukishiro Yanagi of the New Eridu Defense Force. Yanagi saved her from a missile strike and shared her rations, which Soukaku wished to distribute among her clan.

She always wears a respirator mask that filters out Ether particles and pollen while shielding her from prying eyes, a precaution she maintains even in the bustling streets of New Eridu.\n\nBorn in one of the poorest Outer Ring towns, Pulchra grew up dreaming of city life alongside her childhood friend Milena, another Thiren. They role-played urban fantasies, but their Ether aptitudes destined them for mercenary work. Forming a small group with Pulchra in charge, their partnership shattered when Milena stole their funds to escape to the city, knocking Pulchra out and leaving her buried in debt. This betrayal hardened Pulchra, turning her into a lone operator who prioritizes self-interest and aligns only with the strongest allies.\n\nHer path crossed with the Sons of Calydon multiple times. Hired by The Vanquishers' scheming Lucius to sabotage the gang during the Tour de Inferno preparations, Pulchra posed as a member to steal vital vehicle parts, but her ambush failed against their resilience—particularly Burnice White's eccentric charm. Surrendering twice after clashes, including one over the theft of Red Moccus, Pulchra came to respect their power. Following Caesar King's ascension as Overlord, she joined the Sons as an intelligence gatherer, enduring a probationary period of errands that rekindled her sense of camaraderie, though she views the members with tolerant disdain, especially clashing with Burnice's overly affectionate nature.\n\nTo Pulchra, loyalty is fluid, tied to victory and personal gain.

Her all-or-nothing approach has led to blacklisting by numerous clients and scathing reviews on Inter-Knot, yet she remains a reliable ally, having pulled her team through countless perilous situations.\n\nRaised in an orphanage, Nicole formed a deep bond with her best friend, a girl suffering from terminal Ether corruption after getting lost in a Hollow. In a poignant act of kindness, young Nicole rallied the other children to collect Dennies—not for a protective suit they couldn't afford, but to 'buy the sun' by reflecting its light into her friend's window, granting her a final glimpse of daylight. This experience ignited Nicole's lifelong love for money, viewing it as a means to purchase hope. Her friend soon passed away, leaving a lasting impact.\n\nAfter a brief adoption by a prominent family, Nicole returned to the streets and established the agency, originally named Gentle House, which quickly earned its cunning moniker.

These otherworldly voids, influenced by unknown forces, can disorient travelers, leading to peril or loss. The guide emphasizes the role of Proxies—skilled navigators who chart safe paths through these treacherous realms, often aiding those in need while seeking the treasures hidden within.

Enraged, Hugo avenged her by nearly beating the culprit to death before fleeing the family as a young adult. On the streets of the Outer Ring, he encountered the aging phantom thief Jack and his Thiren apprentice, Von Lycaon. Jack mentored Hugo in the art of elegant larceny, instilling a code against needless harm. After Jack's death, Hugo and Lycaon buried him and founded Mockingbird, vowing to plunder the corrupt elite and aid the downtrodden. They enlisted the Bangboo Robin as their nimble accomplice, with Hugo tutoring Lycaon's dramatic flair.\n\nTheir partnership fractured during a heist when Hugo confronted his father, hesitating to kill him in vengeance. This mercy entangled Mockingbird in Hartman Ravenlock's scheme, using a Hollow outbreak to assassinate rivals and innocents. Mistaking Hugo for the slaughterer amid the chaos, Lycaon abandoned him, joining Mayor Mayflower's forces and suffering grievous injuries—losing legs and an eye—while saving lives. Adrift and haunted by Jack's warning of an 'evil seed' inherited from his bloodline, Hugo wandered until he met Vivian, a girl reminiscent of Serena. He trained her, reforming Mockingbird, and infiltrated high society as a collector owning an art gallery, securing ties to the Marcel Group.\n\nYears later, Hugo's path crossed with the Phaethon proxies, leading to a tense reunion with Lycaon. Driven by lingering hatred, he schemed to dismantle the Ravenlocks, even submitting to mind-altering drugs from the Exaltists and faking his death. Ultimately, Hugo confronted his demons, rejecting his family's curse and emerging with a reaffirmed sense of justice—edgy and theatrical on the surface, but rooted in fairness for the oppressed. He wields 'Final Notice,' a scythe disguised as a briefcase, delivering poetic judgment to the wicked under night's cover.","order":100,"position":2,"disable":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":0,"uid":134,"displayIndex":134,"constant":false,"vectorized":true,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":0,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":null,"cooldown":null,"delay":null,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"135":{"key":["Hurcules","Soul of Steel Golden Bond","Event NPC"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"Hurcules","content":"Hurcules is an enigmatic NPC who makes exclusive appearances during the 'Soul of Steel: Golden Bond' event in New Eridu.

Gully's interactions often blend solemn prophecy with opportunistic pleas, such as soliciting 200 Dennies to reopen a 'divine communication channel' to a famed sorcerer, promising in return dominion over the seas, their bounties, and even wind power revenues. Skeptics may liken it to tales of fraudulent princes, but Gully's heart, vast as the ocean it reveres, forgives slights and rewards saviors with 'gifts from the sea'—though these may prove to be little more than sodden fish bones and scales.\n\nFeatured in events like the 'Wish Bottle Adrift' saga, where it embodies the spirit whisperer guiding lost wishes, Gully adds a layer of whimsical mystery to Port Elpis's lore, blurring the line between mechanical whimsy and ancient oceanic legacies.","order":100,"position":2,"disable":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":0,"uid":147,"displayIndex":147,"constant":false,"vectorized":true,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":0,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":null,"cooldown":null,"delay":null,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"148":{"key":["Thiren","fur care","Inter-Knot","hair products"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"Inter-Knot Thread: Thiren Fur Care Recommendations","content":"In the bustling forums of Inter-Knot, a popular platform in New Eridu, beast Thiren users often share tips on managing their unique fur maintenance challenges.

This resurgence has sparked discussions across the Inter-Knot, New Eridu's digital forum, where citizens speculate on their motives—ranging from anti-corporate vigilantism to whimsical performance quotas, humorously dubbed 'KPIs' for criminals.\n\nOne viral post questions if the Mockingbird is 'a bit too active lately,' highlighting their evasion of Public Security (PubSec) despite years of operation. Replies reveal a mix of public sentiment: some dismiss the threat due to the thieves' code against robbing the impoverished, others joke about inviting them to steal subpar collections, and a few express schadenfreude toward affected executives.

Conspiracy theories abound, including whispers of a Mockingbird mole within PubSec, allowing the group to thrive in the shadows of the city's underbelly.\n\nThe Mockingbird embodies the chaotic undercurrents of New Eridu's society, where Hollow incursions and corporate greed create fertile ground for such outlaws.

The evidence, recovered from a ancient monument in a Hollow adjacent to the ruins of the Old Capital, is believed to connect to grave crimes involving Hollow anomalies, such as unauthorized excavations or ether corruption schemes.\n\nFortunately, two Public Security officers, pursuing leads from an unrelated investigation, intervened and reclaimed the evidence during the confrontation in the unstable Hollow environment. This recovery prevented potential dissemination of sensitive data that could exacerbate Hollow-related threats to urban safety.\n\nIn the aftermath, the evidence was transferred to H.A.N.D. (Hollow Affairs and Neutralization Department) for specialized handling, highlighting ongoing jurisdictional frictions between Public Security and H.A.N.D. Community speculation on Inter-Knot suggests the gangs mistook the carrier for a corporate armored transport, expecting lucrative cargo but acquiring materials of little black-market value.

These are realms for seasoned veterans, where survival demands profound knowledge of anomalies and adaptive strategies.\n\nIn contrast, companion Hollows emerge as offshoots from primary expansions, featuring reduced size and milder Ether saturation. Ideal for beginners, they offer safer entry points for building experience, though exceptions like the notorious Dead End Hollow harbor unexpected perils, where even novices might encounter lethal traps.\n\nCommunity responses underscore the risks: 'Lonely Streetlights' warns that high-stakes commissions in major Hollows require established Inter-Knot levels, inaccessible to rookies. 'Paradoxical Vortex' condemns those who entrust novices with critical tasks, risking catastrophe. 'Archaeoceti' laments the system's rigidity, forcing experts on fresh accounts to tackle trivial pursuits like retrieving lost pets from low-risk zones, advocating for account inheritance to bypass such hurdles.\n\nHeed this guidance: research thoroughly, consult peers, and assess personal limits before venturing in.

The duo takes particular delight in ambushing unsuspecting Bangboo at save points, knocking them off ledges and boasting about their \"records\"—such as sending four Bangboo flying in a single session. Their antics are driven by a thrill-seeking personality, viewing the arena as a playground for harmless chaos that \"spices up the game.\"\n\nTrue to Bangboo culture, \"Absolute Trouble\" communicates exclusively through enthusiastic chirps and exclamations like \"ehn-ne!\" and \"nhe-en!\", conveying excitement, mockery, and defiance. When confronted by aggrieved victims—such as Nutty, who was camped and pushed off a ledge, or Pocket, who endured taunts about crying to Public Security—the troublemakers initially brush off the complaints. Officer KK, a stern Public Security enforcer, intervenes, but the Bangboo's defense that their pranks don't violate rules leads to escalation. In one heated encounter, the situation devolves into a tangled brawl among the group, resulting in damaged charging ports and displays for the pranksters. Officer KK eventually hauls them away for re-education, leaving the \"poor\" victims behind.\n\nAlternatively, if de-escalated, the duo narrowly escapes punishment and expresses rare gratitude, inviting fellow fun-seekers to join future escapades. Despite their unchecked troublemaking, \"Absolute Trouble\" embodies the lively, sometimes anarchic spirit of Bangboo society, highlighting the fine line between play and peril in New Eridu's entertainment hubs.

While some praise its potential for modifications that enhance road performance, others decry its instability, joking that it might flip during sharp turns. It's often stereotyped as 'uncool' among younger drivers, who prefer flashier models, and has gained a notorious reputation for being overrepresented in traffic violations—nearly half of reported cases involve speeding or illegal maneuvers in these unassuming cars.
