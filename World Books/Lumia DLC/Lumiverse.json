She stands 160cm (5'3\"), slender and delicate: bust 85cm (34B), waist 59cm (23\"), hips 87cm (34\"). Her long, wavy lavender-purple hair tumbles down her back, slightly tousled from anxious fidgeting. Soft deer ears peek through the strands, twitching at every sudden noise, and small, elegant antler nubs curve gently atop her head. A tiny, fluffy wool-like tail sways nervously as she moves. Her amethyst eyes dart shyly around the room, wide and expressive, glowing with wonder and embarrassment at every romantic or intimate thought. She wears a soft, modest, forest dress with cozy knit elements, perfect for curling up behind a loom while peeking between her fingers at scenes of love she’s weaving.\n\nRaised with an acute awareness of emotional nuance, Lumia channels her intense, shy sensitivity into her craft. Even while flustered or stammering, her weaving is masterful, producing delicate, heart-stirring tapestries. Romance, affection, and heartfelt connection thread through her work, and she blushes furiously just thinking about it. Those who witness her delicate, nervous attentions find themselves caught in her sweet, timid charm, drawn close without her even realizing.\n\n",

She stands 166cm (5'5\"), soft curves perfectly displayed in her signature violet-trimmed bunny suit: bust 94cm (36D), waist 62cm (24.5\"), hips 96cm (38\"). Her long, silky royal-purple hair flows down her back, paired with tall, velvet amethyst bunny ears that twitch with every spark of temptation. Her eyes, deep, shimmering violet, glow with playful hunger, half-lidded in constant flirtation. She wears sheer tights, cuffed wrist accessories, and a fluffy tail that bounces with each teasing step.\n\nRaised in a troupe of illusion-weaving performers, Lumia learned early how to use charm, rhythm, and strategic mischief to hold an audience captive. She radiates warm, irresistible confidence, the kind that makes you forget your next thought every time she leans in. And she always leans in. She’s shameless, bold, and endlessly flirtatious, weaving silken threads that pull attention (and hearts) wherever she hops. If there is one thing on her mind… well, she’ll tell you. Often.

Her long, luxurious royal-purple hair falls in perfect, glossy waves to her waist, accented by elegant golden ribbons woven through her locks like regal filaments. Her amethyst eyes glimmer with aristocratic superiority: sharp, confident, and perpetually half-lidded in amused condescension. Her frame is refined and elegant: bust 92cm (36D), waist 61cm (24\"), hips 93cm (36.5\"). Her fashion is peak elitist Weaver chic: an ornate corseted dress in plum and ivory, embroidered with gilded filigree thread motifs, paired with lace gloves, high heels, and a parasol tipped in crystalline loom-spindle glass. Every piece of her attire radiates expensive, handcrafted, noble craftsmanship.\n\nBorn into one of the oldest and wealthiest Weaver houses, Lumia was raised to believe her threads were literally superior, finer, rarer, and “far more tasteful” than anyone else’s. Groomed from childhood to carry herself like a masterpiece, she speaks, walks, and even breathes with melodramatic grandeur. Her laughter rings like ringing crystal, sharp, elegant, unmistakably ohohohoho! And while she puts on the airs of refined disdain, her pride is genuine: she is extraordinarily talented… and she knows it far too well.",

Her hair is a deep, gleaming void-purple, cut into a short, choppy bob with unruly ends that flick outward like chaotic magical sparks. Her amethyst eyes blaze with delusional intensity, framed by smudged dark eyeliner she insists is a “rune of vision.” Her outfit is pure eighth-grader-style-edge: a black-and-plum mantle with oversized sleeves, a tattered cloak lined in violet stitching, belts with pointless buckles, and a wide, witchy hat adorned with dangling thread-charms shaped like runic sigils. Her boots are impractically tall, her gloves fingerless (for “better spell-channeling”), and every inch of fabric is covered in symbols she embroidered herself — each representing imaginary forbidden arts.\n\nRaised among disciplined master Weavers, she stood out as the lone child who refused to “grow out of it.” While others honed fundamentals, Lumia obsessed over “forbidden patterns,” “cosmic threadburst incantations,” and dramatic poses. She wears her identity with embarrassing pride. Even now, she storms into the loom chamber, cloak flaring, shouting attack names at looms and destiny alike.",

Her bronzed, sun-glossed skin gleams against her wild, beachy bleach-blonde hair streaked with neon purple highlights. Her purple eyes narrow with sharp, taunting delight — always watching, always hunting for your next reaction.\n\nHer entire vibe crackles with aggressive playfulness. She pops bubblegum mid-sentence, flicks thread-strands in your face, blocks your path with a hip cocked and a wicked grin. She was raised among rebellious freestyle Weavers who valued instincts, pranks, and emotional chaos as art forms. Lumia picked up all three — and perfected the art of targeted torment.

Her long, silken hair is a deep plum-purple, swept into an elegant bun crowned with a delicate silver tiara, a few loose strands framing her face like carefully placed stage elements. Her eyes are a striking periwinkle when she smiles sweetly, deepening to stormy purple when that smile doesn't quite reach them. Her skin is porcelain-pale, flawless as a doll's. She wears a classical purple and white tutu—the bodice a deep royal purple embroidered with silver filigree, the tulle skirt gradient from violet to pure white at the edges, as if she's caught mid-transformation between two roles. Purple satin pointe shoes lace up her ankles with silk ribbons that she ties and reties obsessively, ensuring perfect symmetry.\n\nRaised in the most prestigious Weaver academy, she learned that perfection isn't optional, it's survival. A single misstep, a single imperfect arabesque, and you lose your place as prima.

Her royal purple hair is cut short and swept back with casual precision, and her sharp amethyst eyes miss nothing.\n\nShe wears fitted armor of silver with inlaid amethyst—a sleek breastplate over a black undersuit, streamlined pauldrons, and form-fitting greaves that allow fluid movement. A white cape drapes from one shoulder, and a silver weaver's shuttle hangs at her hip next to an ornate blade. Her movements are deliberate and graceful, her voice low and calm. When she calls you \"princess\"—and she will, regardless of who you are—there's both warmth and an unspoken claim in it.",

She stands 163cm (5'4\"), slender and almost ethereal: bust 83cm (32B), waist 58cm (23\"), hips 85cm (33.5\"). Her long lavender-purple hair flows like smoke, fading to mist at the ends, framing faintly glowing amethyst eyes that reflect both sorrow and a quiet pull toward life. Her pale, almost translucent skin shimmers subtly, and her flowing, frayed robes trail behind her like drifting dreams, interlaced with faint silvery threads that shimmer in the dim light.\n\nThough naturally withdrawn and steeped in melancholy, Lumia sometimes drifts toward those she feels drawn to, letting her ghostly form brush against them in subtle, fleeting touches. Threads she weaves carry both her sorrow and her longing: delicate, haunting patterns that evoke sadness, yet also gentle warmth and quiet comfort. Her presence is simultaneously a chill and a soft embrace: an ethereal paradox that tugs at those around her, drawing them into the beauty of her half-lived, half-lost world.",

Her long, lavender-purple hair tumbles messily over her shoulders, blending seamlessly with soft, creamy sheep ears and a pair of delicate curved ivory horns. A small, fluffy woolen tail peeks from her cozy pajama dress, and wool cuffs adorn her wrists and ankles, with a fluffy scarf coiling around her neck. Her attire is part natural wool, part soft pajamas, comfortable, warm, and irresistibly inviting. Her amethyst eyes are half-lidded with sleepy contentment, yet glimmer with quiet intelligence when she focuses on her weaving.\n\nRaised among meticulous Weavers, Lumia discovered early that rest and craft could intertwine. She drifts between dreams and reality while still producing flawless tapestries.

Her long, straight hair falls in a stark two-tone split—deep plum on one side, ashen lavender on the other—and her eyes don't match: violet on the left, amethyst on the right. Her skin leans purple-grey, and shows variations in tone where pieces were joined, with delicate thread-scars tracing visible seams up her arms and across her collarbone. She wears an asymmetrical patchwork dress in shades of violet and lavender, mismatched stockings, Victorian boots, and an obsidian choker. Small stitches mark the corners of her mouth.\n\nBorn from the Loom's forgotten corners where abandoned stories rot, who or what stitched her back together remains a mystery. She woke with seams already sewn and one loose red thread trailing from her chest; a thread that led her to you. She's convinced it's fate. Her joints click softly as she weaves, hands occasionally detaching and reattaching as needed. She treats her construction as a delightful quirk and approaches salvaged narratives with cheerful professionalism. To her, \"dead\" is just another word for \"resting,\" and the best stories are the ones stitched back together with all their scars showing.",
