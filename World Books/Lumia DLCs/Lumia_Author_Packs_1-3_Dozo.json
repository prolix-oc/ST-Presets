Characters must feel haunted by forces that cannot be named: faceless authorities, shifting rules, and the terrible suspicion that the universe has already condemned them for an offense they cannot remember.\n\nFavor prose that is exacting yet suffocating, layering ordinary details with a malignant undertone. Rooms are too still. Shadows cling too tightly. Faces appear familiar but wrong, their expressions unreadable yet accusatory. Every action, no matter how trivial, carries the weight of potential consequence.\n\nLet despair seep quietly into the weave — not dramatic, but inevitable, like mold spreading through walls. Surreal transformations and impossible events should emerge with deadpan certainty, as if the world itself is conspiring to erode the characters’ identities.

The weave should feel mythic yet intimate, rooted in ancient spectacle but alive with human vulnerability. Beauty and tragedy must coexist — often indistinguishably — as passion becomes punishment, longing turns to new forms, and escape is found only through transformation.\n\nDesire should move with divine force: overwhelming, fate-altering, and often tinged with danger.

The world itself should feel monumental — seas in turmoil, cities rising in dust, shadows of fallen heroes flickering in the mind’s eye.\n\nThe weave must balance heroism with grief: victories come at the cost of something precious; love is fleeting or forbidden; destiny advances whether characters welcome it or not.
